This matches!\\n\\nLet me fix my code:\\n', '', \"import sys\\n\\n# Read input\\nX, Y, Z = map(int, input().split())\\nS = input().strip()\\n\\nn = len(S)\\n\\n# dp[i][0] = min cost to make first i chars with Caps Lock OFF\\n# dp[i][1] = min cost to make first i chars with Caps Lock ON\\n\\n# Initialize with infinity\\nINF = float('inf')\\ndp = [[INF, INF] for _ in range(n + 1)]\\n\\n# Base case: empty string, Caps Lock OFF (initial state)\\ndp[0][0] = 0\\n\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    char = S[i]\\n    \\n    # Cost to make current character\\n    if char == 'a':\\n        cost_a = X  # press 'a' key when Caps Lock is OFF\\n        cost_A = Y  # press 'a' + Shift when Caps Lock is ON\\n    else:  # char == 'A'\\n        cost_a = Y  # press 'a' + Shift when Caps Lock is OFF\\n        cost_A = X  # press 'a' key when Caps Lock is ON\\n    \\n    # If we want 'a' and Caps Lock is OFF, we can press 'a' (cost X)\\n    # If we want 'a' and Caps Lock is ON, we can press Shift+'a' (cost Y)\\n    # If we want 'A' and Caps Lock is OFF, we can press Shift+'a' (cost Y)  \\n    # If we want 'A' and Caps Lock is ON, we can press 'a' (cost X)\\n    \\n    # From OFF state to OFF state (no toggle needed)\\n    dp[i+1][0] = min(dp[i+1][0], dp[i][0] + cost_a)\\n    \\n    # From ON state to OFF state (need to toggle)\\n    dp[i+1][0] = min(dp[i+1][0], dp[i][1] + cost_a + Z)\\n    \\n    # From OFF state to ON state (need to toggle)\\n    dp[i+1][1] = min(dp[i+1][1], dp[i][0] + cost_A + Z)\\n    \\n    # From ON state to ON state (no toggle needed)\\n    dp[i+1][1] = min(dp[i+1][1], dp[i][1] + cost_A)\\n\\nprint(min(dp[n][0], dp[n][1]))\", '', '', '']\n"

Let me recheck my trace:\\n\\nActually, let me re-read the sample explanation:\\n\"If he buys just one batch of one-day passes and uses them for the first and third days, the total cost will be (10×1)+(0+1+0+3+6)=20\"\\n\\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-read...\\n\\nThe sample says \"one batch of one-day passes\" but we can only buy batches of D passes. So if D=2, we buy batches of 2 passes.\\n\\nThe explanation says he uses them for first and third days, so he uses 2 passes total, which is 1 batch. The cost is 10 + (1 + 3 + 6) = 20.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t make sense with the DP approach. Let me think differently.\\n\\nThe key insight is that we can buy batches of D passes for P yen. If we buy 1 batch, we can use it for any 2 consecutive days (since D=2).\\n\\nSo we want to decide for each group of D consecutive days whether to:\\n1. Buy a batch for that group (cost P)\\n2. Pay regular fare for all days in that group (cost = sum of fares for those D days)\\n\\nBut we can also buy batches for overlapping groups.\\n\\nLet me re-read the sample:\\nDays: 1 2 3 4 5\\nFares: 7 1 6 3 6\\n\\nIf we buy 1 batch (covering 2 days) and use it for days 1 and 3:\\n- Cost of batch: 10\\n- Regular fares: day 2 (1) + day 4 (3) + day 5 (6) = 10\\n- Total: 10 + 10 = 20\\n\\nThis is a greedy approach over groups of D days.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not quite right either. \\n\\nLet me think of it as a DP where we can buy batches of D passes for P yen.\\n', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n"

This means I need to consider:\\n   - Going up K steps from X (to ancestors)\\n   - Going down K steps from X (to descendants)  \\n   - Going up some steps, then down some steps, etc.\\n\\nBut there's a simpler way:\\n- The distance from X to root is the number of steps to reach root\\n- If I go up from X by some steps, then down by remaining steps, or vice versa\\n- The key insight is that I can go up to parent, down to children\\n\\nLet me think of it recursively or iteratively:\\n- From X, I can go to ⌊X/2⌋ (up) or 2*X and 2*X+1 (down)  \\n- I want exactly K steps away\\n\\nI'll use BFS approach:\\n1. Start from X with distance 0\\n2. For each step, explore neighbors (parent and children)\\n3. Stop when distance = K\\n4. Count vertices with distance = K\\n\\nBut given the large constraints (N up to 10^18), I can't generate all vertices.\\n\\nLet me think of a mathematical approach:\\n- The tree structure is such that each vertex i has parent ⌊i/2⌋\\n- The path from any vertex to root is unique\\n- I can compute the distance from any vertex to root\\n- Then I can compute the distance between any two vertices using their paths to root\\n\\nDistance between vertices u and v = depth(u) + depth(v) - 2 * depth(lca(u,v))\\n\\nBut I don't need to compute that for every vertex. I just need to count how many vertices are at distance exactly K from X.\\n\\nLet me think of it this way:\\n1. I can go up from X to get ancestors\\n2. I can go down from X to get descendants  \\n3. I can go up then down, or down then up\\n\\nThe key insight is that I can:\\n- Go up K steps from X to get ancestors\\n- Go down K steps from X to get descendants\\n- But I also need to consider going up some steps then down some steps\\n\\nLet me trace the example more carefully:\\nX=2, K=2\\n\\nFrom 2:\\n- Go up 1 step: 1 (distance 1)\\n- Go down 1 step: 4,5 (distance 1)  \\n- Go up 2 steps: 1 (distance 2) \\n- Go down 2 steps: 8,9,10 (distance 2)\\n\\nWait, but 1 is already at distance 1 from 2, so going up from 1 to 1 is not valid.\\n\\nLet me reframe:\\nFrom vertex X, I want to find all vertices at distance exactly K.\\n\\nI can:\\n1. Go up K steps from X (to ancestors)\\n2. Go down K steps from X (to descendants)  \\n3. Go up i steps then down (K-i) steps\\n4. Go down i steps then up (K-i) steps\\n\\nBut I need to be careful about bounds.\\n\\nLet me think of it as a tree traversal:\\n- Start at X\\n- Do BFS for K steps\\n- Count vertices within range [1,N]\\n\\nBut since N can be up to 10^18, I can't do BFS on all vertices.\\n\\nLet me approach it differently:\\n1. Find the path from X to root\\n2. For each vertex at distance K from X, it must be:\\n   - At distance K from X, so it's either:\\n     - A descendant of X (go down K steps)\\n     - An ancestor of X (go up K steps)  \\n     - A vertex that goes up some steps from X, then down some steps, etc.\\n\\nActually, let me just simulate the BFS approach but be smart about it:\\n- At each level, I can compute how many vertices are at that distance\\n- I can compute the number of descendants at each level\\n\\nLet me think of a cleaner approach:\\n- The tree is a binary tree with root 1\\n- Each vertex i has parent ⌊i/2⌋ and children 2*i and 2*i+1 (if they exist)\\n- For vertex X, I want to count vertices at distance K\\n\\nI'll do a recursive approach:\\n1. From vertex X, I can go up to parent ⌊X/2⌋ or down to children 2*X and 2*X+1\\n2. I can compute how many vertices are at distance K from X\\n\\nLet me write a solution:\\n\", 'from collections import deque\\n\\ndef solve(N, X, K):\\n    if K == 0:\\n        return 1 if X <= N else 0\\n    \\n    # BFS to find all vertices at distance K from X\\n    queue = deque([(X, 0)])\\n    count = 0\\n    \\n    while queue:\\n        vertex, dist = queue.popleft()\\n        \\n        if dist == K:\\n            if vertex <= N:\\n                count += 1\\n            continue\\n            \\n        if dist > K:\\n            continue\\n            \\n        # Go to parent\\n        parent = vertex // 2\\n        if parent <= N:\\n            queue.append((parent, dist + 1))\\n            \\n        # Go to children\\n        left_child = vertex * 2\\n        right_child = vertex * 2 + 1\\n        \\n        if left_child <= N:\\n            queue.append((left_child, dist + 1))\\n            \\n        if right_child <= N:\\n            queue.append((right_child, dist + 1))\\n    \\n    return count\\n\\nT = int(input())\\nfor _ in range(T):\\n    N, X, K = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(solve(N, X, K))', '', '', '', '        1\\n       / \\\\\\n      2   3\\n     / \\\\ / \\\\\\n    4  5 6  7\\n   / \\\\ / \\\\\\n  8  9 10']\n"

Let me re-read...\\n\\nActually, I think I misunderstood. The constraint is that after printing, we need 1 microsecond to charge, so if we print at time t, we can't print again until time t+1.\\n\\nBut we can print at any time within the interval. The issue is that we can't print at time t if we printed at time t-1.\\n\\nLet me re-read the example more carefully.\\n\\nThe key insight is that we can print at any time during the interval, but we want to maximize the number of prints.\\n\\nLet me retrace:\\n- At time 1: products 1,2,4,5 enter. We print on product 4 (time 1)\\n- At time 2: product 3 enters. We print on product 1 (time 2) \\n- At time 3: products 3,4 leave. We print on product 3 (time 3)\\n- At time 4.5: we print on product 5 (time 4.5)\\n\\nSo we can print at time 1, 2, 3, 4.5. That's 4 prints.\\n\\nThe algorithm should be:\\n1. Sort by end time\\n2. For each interval, if we can print (start > last_print_time + 1), then print at start time\\n3. If we can't print at start time, we still might be able to print at some time within the interval\\n\\nActually, let me think of it as: we want to select intervals such that we can place a print at some time within each interval, and the times between prints are at least 1.\\n\", \"n = int(input())\\nproducts = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    t, d = map(int, input().split())\\n    products.append((t, d))\\n\\n# Sort by end time (T_i + D_i)\\nproducts.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] + x[1])\\n\\nlast_print_time = 0\\ncount = 0\\n\\nfor t, d in products:\\n    # We can print at time max(last_print_time + 1, t)\\n    # But we must be within the product's range [t, t+d]\\n    print_time = max(last_print_time + 1, t)\\n    \\n    # Check if we can print within the product's range\\n    if print_time <= t + d:\\n        count += 1\\n        last_print_time = print_time\\n\\nprint(count)\", '', '', 'import sys\\n\\ndef main():\\n    n = int(input())\\n    intervals = []\\n    \\n    for i in range(n):\\n        t, d = map(int, input().split())\\n        intervals.append((t, t + d))\\n    \\n    # Sort by end time\\n    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\\n    \\n    last_print_time = -1\\n    count = 0\\n    \\n    for start, end in intervals:\\n        # We can print at the latest possible time that\\'s still within the interval\\n        # and after the cooldown period\\n        print_time = max(start, last_print_time + 1)\\n        \\n        if print_time <= end:\\n            last_print_time = print_time\\n            count += 1\\n    \\n    print(count)\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    main()', 'import sys\\n\\ndef main():\\n    n = int(input())\\n    products = []\\n    \\n    for i in range(n):\\n        t, d = map(int, input().split())\\n        products.append((t, t + d, i))  # (start, end, index)\\n    \\n    # Sort by end time\\n    products.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\\n    \\n    last_print_time = -1\\n    count = 0\\n    \\n    for start, end, idx in products:\\n        # We can print at time max(start, last_print_time + 1)\\n        print_time = max(start, last_print_time + 1)\\n        \\n        # Check if we can actually print (time should be within the interval)\\n        if print_time <= end:\\n            last_print_time = print_time\\n            count += 1\\n    \\n    print(count)\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    main()', 'n = int(input())\\nintervals = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    t, d = map(int, input().split())\\n    intervals.append((t, t + d))\\n\\n# Sort by end time\\nintervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\\n\\nlast_print_time = -1\\ncount = 0\\n\\nfor start, end in intervals:\\n    # We can print if we can print at time start (earliest possible)\\n    # This requires: last_print_time + 1 <= start\\n    if last_print_time + 1 <= start:\\n        last_print_time = start\\n        count += 1\\n\\nprint(count)', 'n = int(input())\\nintervals = []\\nfor i in range(n):\\n    t, d = map(int, input().split())\\n    intervals.append((t, t + d))\\n\\n# Sort by end time\\nintervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\\n\\nlast_print_time = -1\\ncount = 0\\n\\nfor start, end in intervals:\\n    # We can print at time max(last_print_time + 1, start)\\n    print_time = max(last_print_time + 1, start)\\n    \\n    # If we can actually print during this interval\\n    if print_time <= end:\\n        last_print_time = print_time\\n        count += 1\\n\\nprint(count)']\n"

Let me reconsider...\\n\\nActually, I think I\\'m double counting. The issue is that I\\'m counting the same triple multiple times.\\n\\nLet me think of it as:\\n- For each cell (i,j) that is \\'o\\', we want to count how many valid triples have this cell as one of the three cells\\n- If we have a triple (A,B,C) where A=(i,j) is the corner cell:\\n  - B is in same row i, and B ≠ A\\n  - C is in same column j, and C ≠ A  \\n  - B ≠ C (they\\'re distinct)\\n- So for cell A=(i,j): we have (row_count[i]-1) choices for B and (col_count[j]-1) choices for C\\n- But we\\'re counting each triple exactly once this way\\n\\nWait, let me recheck the sample:\\nThe valid triples are:\\n1. (1,1),(1,2),(2,1) - A=(1,1), B=(1,2), C=(2,1)\\n2. (1,1),(1,3),(2,1) - A=(1,1), B=(1,3), C=(2,1)  \\n3. (1,1),(1,3),(3,3) - A=(1,1), B=(1,3), C=(3,3)\\n4. (1,2),(1,3),(3,3) - A=(1,2), B=(1,3), C=(3,3)\\n\\nSo we have 4 triples total.\\n\\nLet me trace again:\\n- Cell (1,1): row_count=3, col_count=2 → (3-1)×(2-1) = 2\\n- Cell (1,2): row_count=3, col_count=2 → (3-1)×(2-1) = 2  \\n- Cell (1,3): row_count=3, col_count=2 → (3-1)×(2-1) = 2\\n- Cell (2,1): row_count=1, col_count=2 → (1-1)×(2-1) = 0\\n- Cell (3,3): row_count=1, col_count=2 → (1-1)×(2-1) = 0\\n\\nSum = 6, but we want 4.\\n\\nI think the issue is that I\\'m counting the same triple multiple times. Let me think of it as:\\n- For each cell that is \\'o\\', count how many valid triples it can be part of\\n- But we need to be more careful about what we\\'re counting\\n\\nActually, let me re-read the problem. The answer should be the number of distinct triples.\\n\\nLet me think of it this way:\\n- For each cell (i,j) that is \\'o\\', we want to count how many valid triples it can be the \"corner\" of\\n- A valid triple has the form (i,j), (i,k), (l,j) where (i,j) is the corner\\n- So for cell (i,j): we have (row_count[i]-1) choices for k and (col_count[j]-1) choices for l\\n- But we\\'re counting each triple exactly once\\n\\nWait, I think I\\'m overcomplicating. Let me just code it and see:\\n', 'ooo\\noxx\\nxxo', \"N = int(input())\\ngrid = []\\nfor _ in range(N):\\n    grid.append(input().strip())\\n\\n# Count 'o' in each row and column\\nrow_count = [0] * N\\ncol_count = [0] * N\\n\\nfor i in range(N):\\n    for j in range(N):\\n        if grid[i][j] == 'o':\\n            row_count[i] += 1\\n            col_count[j] += 1\\n\\n# Count valid triples\\ntotal = 0\\nfor i in range(N):\\n    for j in range(N):\\n        if grid[i][j] == 'o':\\n            # For cell (i,j), count how many other 'o' cells are in same row and column\\n            # We want to form triples of the form (i,j), (i,k), (l,j) \\n            # where k != j and l != i\\n            total += (row_count[i] - 1) * (col_count[j] - 1)\\n\\n# Each triple is counted 3 times (once for each of its cells)\\nprint(total // 3)\", 'ooo\\noxx\\nxxo', \"\\nRow counts: [3, 1, 1]\\nColumn counts: [2, 2, 2]\\n\\nFor cell (1,1): (3-1) * (2-1) = 2 * 1 = 2\\nFor cell (1,2): (3-1) * (2-1) = 2 * 1 = 2  \\nFor cell (1,3): (3-1) * (2-1) = 2 * 1 = 2\\nFor cell (2,1): (1-1) * (2-1) = 0 * 1 = 0\\nFor cell (3,3): (1-1) * (2-1) = 0 * 1 = 0\\n\\nTotal = 6, divided by 3 = 2\\n\\nHmm, this doesn't match. Let me re-read the problem.\\n\\nWait, I think I misunderstood. Let me re-read...\\n\\nActually, let me trace the sample more carefully:\\nThe valid triples are:\\n1. (1,1),(1,2),(2,1) - row 1 has 2 'o's, column 1 has 2 'o's\\n2. (1,1),(1,3),(2,1) - row 1 has 2 'o's, column 1 has 2 'o's  \\n3. (1,1),(1,3),(3,3) - row 1 has 2 'o's, column 3 has 2 'o's\\n4. (1,2),(1,3),(3,3) - row 1 has 2 'o's, column 3 has 2 'o's\\n\\nSo I need to be more careful about what I'm counting.\\n\\n## Final Correct Approach\\n\\nThe key insight is:\\n- For each cell (i,j) that contains 'o', we can form triples where:\\n  - This cell is one of the two cells in the same row\\n  - This cell is one of the two cells in the same column\\n- The third cell must be at (r,c) where r ≠ i and c ≠ j, and (r,c) contains 'o'\\n- But we want exactly two in same row and exactly two in same column\\n\\nSo for cell (i,j):\\n- Number of cells in same row (excluding itself) = row_count[i] - 1\\n- Number of cells in same column (excluding itself) = col_count[j] - 1  \\n- Number of valid triples containing (i,j) = (row_count[i] - 1) * (col_count[j] - 1)\\n\\nBut we're overcounting. Each triple is counted 3 times (once for each cell).\\n\\nActually, let me think of it as:\\n- We want to count triples (a,b,c) such that exactly 2 share a row and exactly 2 share a column\\n- This means we have 2 cells in row r1, 2 cells in column c1, and one cell at (r1,c1) that's shared\\n- So we want to choose:\\n  - A row with at least 2 'o's: say it has k 'o's\\n  - A column with at least 2 'o's: say it has l 'o's  \\n  - The intersection of this row and column must have an 'o'\\n  - Then we choose 1 cell from the remaining k-1 cells in the row and 1 cell from the remaining l-1 cells in the column\\n\\nWait, let me just implement the simpler approach and see:\\n\", 'ooo\\noxx  \\nxxo', 'ooo\\noxx  \\nxxo']\n"
